               Although our method degrades in the region where it ovelaps with the strong wind noise but the speech is clean and the 
               words can be easily understood.

               Here, we can observe that the background noise like car honking and random chatter is decreased significantly. Also towards the end
               of the video an engine like noise can be heard in the original video and this has completely been removed by our method.
